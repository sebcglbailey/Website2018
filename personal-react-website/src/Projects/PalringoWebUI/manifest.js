    "Designing the web-client for the Palringo social gaming app. As part of the creative team, myself and one other designer helped shape the overall look and feel, and User Experience of the new <a target='_blank' href='http://chat.palringo.com' title='Palringo Chat web client'>web-client</a>, for the app.",
    "Not being a native app, we were not constricted to best practice standards, and could experiment with changing the UX from the current application. The chat became much more fluid, allowing new users to get straight into the core functionality of the platform, and also allowing users to flick between different groups with ease."
