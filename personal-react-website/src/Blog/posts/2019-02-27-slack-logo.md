We've all seen the news and arguments about Slacks "new" logo. And we all have our opinions. Well here's mine.

# Why?!

I get the reasoning behind the redesign. Slack needed to reach new audiences in order to expand their customer base. They were too 'start-up'-y. The logo would be misused and cause unknown branding error.s They needed to be taken a bit more seriously. That's all good and well, but how is making their logo look like a circle of ['aubergines'](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxEb4tmXQAUMnNk.jpg), or 4 ducks, count as being more serious?

## An alternative

One of the things that annoys me most about the new logo is that it really doesn't look like an octothorpe (a # symbol), which is so classically Slack. Their whole product is based around the # being the staple of a channel, and they [really did try and keep it as a staple of the logo](https://www.pentagram.com/work/slack) (apparently), but nobody looks at the logo and sees a # when they do.

Something as simple as changing the colours of the shapes in the logo can help with this:

*A simple change can make the octothorpe stand out so much more, rather than look like a catherine wheel of colour*

## A better alternative

Anything but what it is now.
