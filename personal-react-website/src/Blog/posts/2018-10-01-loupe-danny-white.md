## Post-war European Architecture

The main take away of Danny's talk was his great comparison between digital design today, and architecture in post-war Europe.

He used a great example of Amsterdam's Bijlmermeer neighbourhood, being just a short drive away, to start off his explanation of this comparison.

So much of the architecture in post-war Europe had some great ideals. Building a better life for people, creating these mega cities that would provide safe, affordable housing for everyone.

The most notable architect of the time, and biggest advocat of the 'mega-cities' ideals, was Le Corbusier. And although Le Corbusier is still praised to this day for many of his ideas and architecture, there were significant problems with this approach to city planning that Danny drew comparisons with.

The architects of the time were given a lot of power to design and build projects just like the Bijlmer. Unfortunately, there was little to no consideration into what it meant for the people who would actually be living in these new cities, or for the people already living in the spaces they would be taking over.

Although in theory, it should have worked, the architects didn't spend time with the inhabitants, in order to really solve the problems that they had.

The cities were tearing down large percentages of already colonised land, to make way for these new cities. Crime rates were too high. And the these cities were in large, left to their own devices, and saw a great deal of decay.

## The comparisons

While not quite as dear as the problems were at the time, there are definitely lessons to be learned from these mega cities, for all of us digital designers today.

There are millions of people that use our products every day, and we can and do have the opportunity to really change people's lives for the better.

### So what do we need to do in order to not make the same mistakes?

#### Design with data
Using data will allow us to really solve the crux of the problems, and not what we see to be the problems.

#### Don't follow suit and 'Design from above'
Designing from above is the biggest problem these architects made. We need to get to know our users; find out what they really want and need. And the way to do this is to talk to them, put ourselves in their shoes.

#### Look at how people are using our products

> The best way to design for downtown, is to see how people are using it today.

Similar to the point above. But really looking and studying how people use our products today is a great way to figure out what they might do with our designs.
