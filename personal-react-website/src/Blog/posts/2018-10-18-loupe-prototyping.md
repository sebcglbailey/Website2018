## The speakers

May-Li Khoe and Linda Dong both worked together in the past at Apple, and their presentation styles certainly came through. Both were very elequent and managed to present their ideas in fun and engaging ways; both getting the most interaction, and biggest laughs out of the audience all day.

Both speakers touched on physical prototypes, and the importance of rough and ready ones, over the polished ones we see coming from products like Framer.

That's not to say they didn't see the power of Framer and Framer X, but they wanted to just show everyone how useful a physical or much quicker prototype can help make sure you are designing the right solution for the problem at hand, rather than just jumping to conclusions.

## May-Li Khoe

Somehow getting everyone up out of their seats and doing a hula dance is surely testament enough for May-Li's presentation.

But the take away from the talk was that you can really have fun with your prototypes.

<a href="http://www.maylikhoe.com/" target="_blank">May-Li Khoe</a> is working at Khan Academy, and showed some of the work she has got up to there, which included some amazing technological prototypes to teach children in interesting and interactive ways.

Her talk started by looking at the little wiggle the app icons do on your iPhone homepage when you move them around, and how at Apple it was fondly called 'The Hula'. She explained how actually the Hula dance is a much slower dance than people think, and the fast dance that people usually associate with it is actually a Fijian dance called the Meke.

She got everyone out of their seats, teaching us one by one, the 3 different axial movements our hips can make. Combing them all together to some music at the end, we were eventually dancing the Hula. She then proceeded to show us what the app wiggle would look like done at the normal pace of the Hula, which was a weirdly funny slower and calmer movement on the screen.

## Linda Dong

Linda's talk was similarly presented in an engaging way that included some of her past experiences (none of which were obviously with Apple, due to annoying NDA's).

She wanted to hit home the importance of prototyping early, and not to worry about high fidelity designs – the best thing to do can sometimes be to just very quickly draw some sketches on pieces of paper, go out onto the streets and ask random people for their feedback.

Sometimes, we as designers can jump straight to the solution we think is best, even at the very beginning, and we could quite easily be making a lot of assumptions we may not even realise we are making. Getting out there and testing early, no matter what it looks like, is the only real way to get the real user needs and pain points.

The example she used was when she worked with Lyft, and they started out with pads of paper, asking strangers in the street what they thought of the interface and interaction. This then informed some decisions they made when building a cardboard car in the office, with a screen emulating the experience of a car on the road.

This 'rough' prototype, even though it was a fairly complex one ultimately led to the prototype shown to the key stakeholders, and eventually a real product.

The importance here is that if they jumped straight into building a prototype car experience, they could have wasted a lot of time building the wrong product or interaction. Getting out onto the streets early and asking users what they though on paper ultimately led them to making the right decisions early on, and not wasting time building something that might not necessarily work.

In essence, the take away from the whole talk was this simple and great diagram of the different types of prototypes:
