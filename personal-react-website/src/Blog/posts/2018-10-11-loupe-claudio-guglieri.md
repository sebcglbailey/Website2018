[Back to overview](2018-09-26-loupe-intro)

The opening sequence to Claudio's presentation was I think the highlight of the conference for me.

The lights went down, music started to play, and up on the screen there was a simple welcome message.

Then the words started to change. Slowly, a single word (beautiful typography too I might add) would appear on the screen welcoming people to the conference. They then started to be about reading speeds, still single words just displayed beautifully on the projector. The speed that they were changing was apparently the average reading speed of a child.

The music began to pick up pace, and with it, the words too. As the video went on, the words picked up speed more and more and you could almost hear everyone in the room trying to keep up with the ever increasing rate. I think I managed to get up to the speed at which an average higher education student reads, but lost it when it moved up to professors. (I think it was about 600 words per minute).

## So what was the point in this?

Within the content (if you could just about keep up), we were let know that the reading speed on screens is significantly slower than it is on paper. This means that we need to take care in the content that we push to our users' screens.

Our users are all human, and therefore we need to be designing with human limitations in mind. That's not to say that our designs are going to start only showing content one word at a time, but the more content that we have on our screens - the more words our users need to consume - then the longer they will have to be looking at those screens, which can strain the eyes.

## The rest

We all love designing beautiful mock ups and innovative interfaces to solve problems in new and intersting ways. But how often do we actually think about why we are making some of those decisions?

Do we always think about how people hold their phones, and thus the reach of their thumbs and fingers?

What about the physical situation the user is in when they are most likely to be using our products? Are they in public? Is the content on screen something that might be sensitive? What about if it's likely to be sunny and there might be glare on the screen?

Claudio urged us to really consider the physical, cognitive and visual limitations of the human side of our users when we design our products, and to not forget the simple rules that determine how usable our products are.

He urged that only once you knew and truly understood these rules, is when we can begin to break them.
