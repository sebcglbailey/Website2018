Anyone who knows me, will probably tell you that manual labour isn't exactly the first thing they would expect me to be doing on a weekend. But that is exactly what I decided to do a few months ago.

My wife and I had recently bought our first house, and we were planning all sorts of home improvements. It being the summer, (and having a crazy 6 week heat wave) the garden was the first thing we tackled. I had the crazy idea of saving some money and building a patio by hand myself, and got about to planning it.

I spent a few weeks psyching myself up to actually getting around to it. I watched tonnes of youtube videos on how to go about it, from laying the slabs, to how mix your own concrete. I think at this point, it was still a bit of a dream I had, and nobody quite thought I'd actually ever get round to it.

But one weekend, I decided to finally start, and spent an arduous amount of energy digging up the back of the garden to make way for the foundations for the new patio.

## The start of the pain

What anyone that has done something similar will understand, is that what all those youtube videos on how to lay your own foundations make look easy, is the digging part. They all seem to do the videos in a very easy to manage area, with soft ground, and lots of help. Well this was just me, and I live in Surrey, so the ground is incredibly chalky, and the garden isn't exactly flat.

So to lay the patio, I had to flatten out a considerable area of the garden, and as soon as I got more than a couple of inches below the surface, I would hit rock. The chalk would break up as I hit it, but it's still a tremendous amount of effort to break up 16 sq. metres of chalk.

*This was actually after I realised I wouldn't be able to go to ground level, but you can sort of see how much digging was involved*

Eventually, I got a stage where I just couldn't dig any deeper. I ended up having to make the decision to build a slightly raised patio, and I would have to lay a couple of courses of brick to raise the slabs slightly. Problem solved.

*I marked out where I wanted the edge of the patio to be, and flattened the soil to that point*

## Laying the foundations.

This was actually a lot of fun, but a lot of hard work. I had to lay the foundations for the brick edging, but also a garden wall that I was planning on building at the back of the patio. This meant digging a sizable trench all the way around the area of the patio, and mixing my own concrete.

Thankfully, I decided to rent a cement mixer for a day to actually mix all the concrete. If I hand't I don't think I would have been able to finish the foundations, and would probably just have a huge hole in my garden to this day.

The problem was lugging all of the materials I needed from my front garden, to the back. I live on a hill, so it meant pushing ~1.5 tonnes of rock and sand in a wheelbarrow from the front of my house, uphill, to the back. That took me a couple of weekends to finish actually, and was one of the hardest parts of the job.

Anyway, finally finishing off the foundations at the end of a very sweaty saturday was incredibly rewarding, and I could finally see progress being made.

*At this point in time, I also started looking into materials for the patio, and settled on blue/black limestone*

After that, I lay the brick edging, and had to lug another ~1.5 tonnes of rock and sand from front to back of house again, for the sub base and mortar bed. First layer was the sub base, which I had to rake about for a good amount of time, trying to get a level area (with a slight incline for drainage). After it was level, I went over it compacting it down with a strip of wood and a sledge hammer. I was told this was the most back breaking part of the job, but I have to say, this was relatively easy compared to the digging and moving the material.

*Filling in the sub base was a hard job, that's a lot of rock to lug around!*

On top, I put a huge sheet of weed control material, and stapled it down with some pins. Finally, the slabs were ready to be laid!

## Laying the slabs

I was so close, and could see the end in sight!

![Test slab](/static/media/src/Blog/src/images/2019-03-12-building-a-patio/09_test_slab.jpg)
*I had received the slabs by now, and wanted to see how it would look on against the brick*

I had the choice of going with the more difficult method of a full mortar bed, or using the 5 point method, but as I was using fairly large and very nice limestone slabs, I decided to do it properly and try and lay a full mortar bed. ...This was so hard!

![Sand layer](/static/media/src/Blog/src/images/2019-03-12-building-a-patio/10_sand.jpg)
*Getting the sand level was much harder than the sub base*

Looking back, I wish I had taken more time to get a fully level area, as there are definitely a couple of slabs that don't lie flat with the rest of the patio, but overall, I think I managed to do a good job with the full mortar bed. I think the hardest thing about this was actually mixing all the mortar, as I no longer had a cement mixer, and had to do this all by hand.

![Slabs laid out](/static/media/src/Blog/src/images/2019-03-12-building-a-patio/11_wet_finish.jpg)
*Here are all of the slabs laid down, before I pointed them. You can see how hard it is to get a completely flat area! But overall, I'm happy with the result*

## Pointing

After waiting a full week for the patio slabs to settle into the mortar and set, I went around pointing the slabs. It didn't take too long but after spending a few hours on my hands and knees, it did start to ache a bit.

The saving grace here was that the mixing of the mortar wasn't too hard, as the sand was wet enough not to warrant adding any extra water, and it mixed with the cement pretty easily.

## Learnings

I had done it!

I still need to build the garden wall on two of the edges, I will update this post when I've done this, but I'm certainly proud of my achievement so far.

Looking back there are probably a few things I would do again, and a few I would have done differently:

* I'm so glad I've done it all myself; there's nothing quite like the sense of achievement doing a job like that on your own, and it certainly gives you some new skills.
* Picking the right slabs. The limestone looks amazing, especially after sealing it properly. And the size and layout of them looks pretty modern I would say, so I'm happy I spend a bit more money on some proper natural limestone slabs from Bradstone.
* I probably should have brought in some heavy machinery to dig up the garden a bit deeper. Having done it by hand was completely knackering, and I could have gotten a better level if I had used an actual digger.
* I should have taken more time over leveling the foundations and sub base layer. There are a couple of bricks and slabs that are noticably wonky, but not so much that it will make a big impact on the overall aesthetic.
* Sealing the slabs should have been done prior to laying them. As they are limestone, they have absorbed some of the cement from the pointing along the edges of the slabs, which is made worse by the fact they are black. I have managed to clean them to a point, but they aren't quite as perfect as I would have hoped.
* Get help! It's hard work lugging everything around by yourself, and having someone else on hand to help would have been nice, but again, sense of achievement and whatnot.

Hopefully this post may inspire people to go out and try something they never thought they could do. Its tough work, but so rewarding at the end of the day!
