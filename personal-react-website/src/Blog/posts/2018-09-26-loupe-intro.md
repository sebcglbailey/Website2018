First of all, I want to thank the guys and gals at Framer for putting on a fantastic few days over in Amsterdam. They did an absolutely fantastic job at organising the conference, and the talks they put on were second to none. 

It was great to put some faces to names of so many people that are a huge part of the community, and to really geek out about all things Framer.

## The format

You'd be forgiven for thinking that being a Framer conference, the talks would all be about using the tool, and Framer X, the new product they launched the day before. Much to the agreement of everyone I have spoken to though, it was well separated from the tool, and all of the speakers were focused on a much broader topic of design and prototyping in general.

It was refreshing to be able to gain some inspiration from the speakers, as well as spend the breaks and surrounding days talking and geeking out about Framer with the community.

## The speakers

### Danny White

Danny spoke about the perils of design today.

The digital world as we know it, and our role in it as digital designers, could be compared to the power and vision post-war modernist architects had.

### Mina Markham

Mina's presentation was all about her experience building design systems for the Hilary Clinton presidency campaign, and Slack.

She expanded on her mistakes and successes in both roles, and spoke about some of the limitations design systems can have.

### Claudio Guglieri

Claudio started off his talk with a fantastic video on reading speeds, culminating in an insanely fast array of words, many of the audience struggled to keep up with (but that was the point).

He went on to talk in depth about designing for humans, and their physical needs.

### Julia Khusinova

I was particularly intrigued by Julia's talk, as some of the issues she covered are very much at the forefront of my mind, as we continue to build our design team at ClearScore.

She covered how we can build trust within our organisations as a design team, and the processes we can cover to do this.

### May-Li Khoe

The highlight of the day for a lot of people I'm sure, May-Li showed us how we can have fun with our prototypes.

Full of energy, she managed to get everyone up out of their seats for 5 minutes, doing a Hula dance.

### Linda Dong

Another ex-Apple designer, Linda spoke about the importance of sharing your prototypes early. It doesn't matter if they aren't beautiful, the quicker you gain feedback, the quicker you can iterate.

### Holly Habstritt Gaal

A priority for many design teams and individuals, Holly was speaking about how we can be ethical within our roles, teams and organisations.

### Kristoffer Brady

A powerful and truly honest talk by Kristoffer, had him share some of his harder moments in his career, and how he overcame and used those hard moments, to propel him into a different direction, which has seen him build futuristic UIs for the likes of 'What Happened to Monday' and 'Black Panther.'
