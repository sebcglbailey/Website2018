Anyone in the tech community in London (and beyond for that matter) would have been hard pressed not to hear the recent news stories about Revolut. Wired released an article on their toxic culture, their blatant copies of some Spotify ads from a couple of years ago have been accused of single-shaming, and their CFO has recently resigned over news breaking that they were knowingly ignoring strict anti money laundering laws.

## What makes a toxic culture?

All you have to do is read the aforementioned article from Wired to realise that the culture at Revolut is a prime example of what is wrong with the tech industry (and other industries for that matter). But I don't want to focus on Revolut, more just general musings about how a culture can sour.

### Time management

I think the biggest thing for me is that so many in tech *expect* their staff to work like dogs. I get that start-ups in particular have an inherit work ethic about them. It's inevitible â€“ a start-up by definition doesn't have enough staff to produce all of the work that is needed. Everyone wears many hats and will find themselves doing lots of different jobs under their one title. But this doesn't mean that *every* tech company can do this, and carry on doing it after they are no longer start ups.

Using the Slack message from Revolut's CEO as an example, he *expected* his POs to be working weekends, overtime without the pay, to make up for missing ridiculously difficult targets. If those POs want to work on their weekends, that is up to them, and I'm not saying that people shouldn't work on their down time if they want to, but to expect it as part of the job is another story.

It is fundamentally detrimental to everyone's wellbeing, both physical and mental, to have some down time away from work, relaxing with friends, and resting. The expetancy for everyone to follow in the footsteps of the CEO's workaholic 100 hour weeks is ridiculous.

### Black and white, delivery focused performance reviews

Tech companies thrive on the agile process, and it works to deliver results. But at what cost? The product may suffer further on down the line, or it might mean that people are working too much overtime to get the project finished.

Having such a focus on delivery for performance reviews will mean that people work beyond their means, sometimes just to keep their jobs. Agile was also built with software engineering being the primary focus. What about marketing? Design? HR? How do you work in an agile way with work that is more subjective?

Agile works for a lot of people, but to base everything on it, from bonuses, to actual performance reviews, can be really stressful, and can cause
